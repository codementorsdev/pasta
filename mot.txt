Prologue:

In modern software development environments driven by Agile and DevOps methodologies, continuous testing plays a crucial role in ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of high-quality applications. While unit and integration testing are often automated, achieving seamless orchestration of comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios remains a complex challenge. Organizations require solutions that not only automate these scenarios but also simulate real-world production workflows involving multiple interconnected systems and dynamic data flows.

Motivation:

As software ecosystems grow more complex and distributed, the ability to execute integrated, production-like tests becomes increasingly vital. Enterprises need automation tools that support end-to-end workflows, maintain data consistency throughout the test lifecycle, and ensure clear traceability from test definition to execution. This requires a tightly integrated mechanism that connects test management platforms with CI/CD systems while also handling runtime test data effectively across multiple pipelines.

Business Problem:

Current test automation tools and frameworks often function in isolation. There is limited integration between test management systems like SquashTM and CI/CD platforms such as GitLab, making it difficult to coordinate comprehensive end-to-end test executions. Additionally, data generated during one test pipeline cannot easily be transferred or reused in another, disrupting the continuity required for authentic testing scenarios. These limitations result in fragmented testing processes, lower coverage of real-world use cases, and increased manual effortâ€”ultimately impacting software quality and slowing down delivery cycles.

Solution:

To address these challenges, we propose an End-to-End Test Automation Pipeline Orchestration application. This platform enables users to configure and sequence GitLab test automation pipelines by mapping each step to defined test cases in SquashTM, ensuring structured and traceable test execution. It also supports the reading, parsing, and ingestion of runtime-generated test data, enabling seamless data exchange between multiple pipelines. This allows for the simulation of realistic, production-like test scenarios where data flows through several interconnected systems. The platform empowers teams to automate complex workflows, increase test coverage, reduce manual effort, and ensure higher confidence in software releases.
